I have developed a responsive To-Do List website that incorporates CRUD operations using EJS, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. This application allows users to efficiently create, read, update, and delete tasks through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Leveraging EJS for dynamic content rendering and MongoDB for data storage, the application ensures smooth and scalable task management. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, handles server-side logic and routing with ease. Importantly, the website features a responsive design, achieved through custom CSS and media queries, ensuring seamless functionality and accessibility across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This comprehensive approach provides a robust and efficient solution for managing daily tasks, delivering a consistent and optimized user experience on any screen size.
